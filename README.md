# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the classic Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset contains demographic and travel information for the passengers, and the goal is to analyze the data and build predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about the passengers on the RMS Titanic, including whether they survived the shipwreck or not. Here are the key fields in the dataset:

- **Passenger Information**: Name, gender, age, passenger class.
- **Ticket Information**: Ticket number, fare, cabin.
- **Travel Details**: Port of embarkation.
- **Family Relationships**: Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard.
- **Survival Status**: Indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

## Project Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.
- Preprocess the data for modeling.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict survival.

## Machine Learning Models

- **Logistic Regression**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
